# `ADR` Remark guided markdown
<!--
  This is the original draft of how the adr templates will look like
  We start with some metadata, here you can set the status, creation date, deciders etc. 
-->

> [!NOTE]  
> **This is still to be decided:**  
> Should this blob of yaml live at the top of the document in the `frontmatter` section or should it stay here in this separate section so it's always visible to the reader, even on github.  

```yml
status: proposed
created: 2025-11-19
deciders: 
- marvin-brouwer
```

<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
There seems to be quite some "documentation format" drift between companies and people. \
To prevent a wild growth of different standards, an open standard may be created. 

Documenting in markdown is the preferred solution as per [..](..).  \
However, just a standard markdown example template alone might not suffice, to aide in writing these complex documents a template might be useful.
To facilitate a unified template, pure markdown is too loose.
We can create a template, like many others have done. However, this is error prone and vulnerable to entropy.

## Decision:
<!-- Summary: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->

Use a custom [remark][remark] plugin in conjunction with [the `unifiedjs.vscode-remark` vscode plugin][unifiedjs.vscode-remark] that forces a _**configurable**_ template and adds guided documentation while writing.

### Drivers

### [remark][remark]

We will be using [remark][remark] plugins to create a custom linter since they are simple to implement.

### [json schema][json-schema]
To make a flexible, extendable, and, standardized way of building our own standard. We will be using jsonschemas. \
It's a well documented and mature solution for creating templates.

### [vscode: `unifiedjs.vscode-remark`][unifiedjs.vscode-remark]
Using this plugin in conjunction with our bespoke remark plugins, will allow us to show inline errors while editing markdown. Additionally, it may provide us with code suggestions and inline documentation.

### Alternatives

#### [vscode: `markdownlint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/markdownlint/)  

> Markdownlint is an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor that includes a library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files. It is powered by the markdownlint library for Node.js 
  
<!-- ##### Dismissal   -->

This is a fine plugin for rule-based markdown linting.   \
However, the extension of this linter seems a lot less straightforward as remark's plugin.

## Outcome

<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->

Once finished this product should facilitate a set of useable documentation templates, that works in markdown with no more setup than a vscode plugin which is useful to begin with.

### Pros and cons

<!-- Tell us about the pros and cons -->

`pro` Markdown support OOTB \
`pro` Standardized way of working across ADRs \
`pro` Existing vscode plugin, no new language requirements, no DSL. \
`pro` Inline guides 

`con` A new standard to adopt
